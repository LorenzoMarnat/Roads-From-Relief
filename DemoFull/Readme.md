### Camera Controller

* **Left-click + drag** : User "grabs" the ground (cursor stays at the same spot on the ground) to translate camera on XY axis.
* **Right-click + drag** : camera rotation around the focus point (ground point at the center of the screen), clamped to avoid going under ground level.
* **Mousewheel** : smooth zoom toward the ground point under the mouse cursor, adjusted according to the ground distance (zoom is faster the further from the ground and cannot go through the ground).
* **Mousewheel click** (middle mouse button) : "Smart Zoom". Camera smoothly moves and rotates toward target ground point, at fixed orientation and adjusted distance.
* **S** : moves and orients camera to the start view
* **T** : moves and orients camera to top view (high altitude and pointing toward the center of the city)

The camera controller has been merged into itowns ([PR](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/pull/454)) and is now PlanarControls. It features an animation of camera movement and orientation (called "travel" in the code) which we use to orient the camera with a document (document **oriented view**).
